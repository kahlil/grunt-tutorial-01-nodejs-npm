## The Basics: Install Node.js & npm

Welcome to Grunt basics, I am Kahlil and in this short screencast I am going to show you how to install Node.js and npm on your machine.

First off, let's talk about what Node.js and npm are.

## Node.js

Node.js basically is Google's V8 machine modified in a way so that it can run on any computer. Which means, you can run it on your local machine or on a server.

## npm

npm is a package manager for Node modules. It allows you to install, bulk-install, manage and update Node modules with ease from the central npm registry.

Once you installed Node and npm you will have two new commands available on your command line:

    node

and

    npm

Once both are installed you will be using the `npm` command much more than the node command. You will use it to install Grunt and Grunt plugins it also can help you to create a package.json file. More on that in the following screencast.

## How to install Node & npm

If you are on Windows or on a Mac the easiest way to install Node is to download the correct binary for your OS on nodejs.com and to install it. The binaries will install npm next to Node.js automatically.

## Keeping up to date

Node.js is still young, hasn't reached v1.0 yet and is moving forward very quickly. So it is important that you update your Node and npm installations regularly. The newest version of Grunt mostly also depends on the newest Node version to work properly.

## How to keep Node up to date

There are several ways to keep your Node and npm installations up to date.

Of course you can just go to nodejs.com and download the new binary and install it over the old one. But there are more elegant ways.

## n

Once you have npm installed you can go ahead and install on the Mac or ... on Windows. They are Node version management tools. They allow you to install different versions of Node next to each other and to switch between them.

Call `n` on the Mac and you will get a list of all the available Node versions on your computer and you can choose the version number you need.

## npm

Once you have npm installed you can install the node module called npm to update npm via the command line.

Just make sure you call it with sudo on the Mac or on Linux otherwise it will screw up and you'll need to install it via the binary again.

## Brew and Scoop

You can also install Node and npm with a packaga manager for your OS. On Mac the package manager of choice would be Brew and on Windows scoop.sh looks really good.

They will allow you to easily install and upgrade Node and npm over the command line.

That's it for now.
